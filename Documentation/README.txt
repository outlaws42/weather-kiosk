The reason for writing this program was for 2 reasons.
    1) I wanted learn more about programming in python. I did learn alot
        while working on this I still have alot to learn.
    2) I wanted take a raspberry pi B that I had laying around and added a  5"
        display to create a weather display. Getting the outside weather from a online
        service and providing inside temp with a sensor DHT22.
        I know this isn't the most accurate  vs a outside sensor at your location.
        I had some failed devices like that. so I decided to do a project
        getting that info from the internet.

How to use.
   


The weather channel is used by default
    it has the most info avaliable to you.
